Cluster 5, #9 Elements 
	 On a macro level, all of these places are areas that I would consider to be a part of Springfield and its broader community/metropolitan
	  The population of each of the highlighted cities outside of Springfield interacts with Springfield in many important ways
	 People who live and work in these areas are connected strongly to the Springfield downtown area
	 South-side-ish Springfield, this includes our home, our retail area with both franchises, chain, and small businesses, outdoor space and parks with green space and community emphasis on outdoor activities such as bike trails, running trails, and includes access to our hospitals - it feels like a good combination of suburban/urban
	 People living in the greater Springfield area with similar interests
	 An area that shares common issues of traffic, water flow, population density around MSU, economic development, poverty, and people who drive into Springfield to work, back and forth
	   Residents have larger lots but most work in Springfield
	  This area of Springfield is in need of community development and upgraded infrastructure
	 My home, many of my friends, my children's schools, church, work, and most of the places I go for shopping or entertainment are located in the map area, all primarily in central Springfield
